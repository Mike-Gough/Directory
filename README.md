# Directory
## What is this project about?
Prototyping a directory as a way to demonstrate a repository which allows storing, searching and correlation of keys from disparate IT systems.

## What problem does a directory help solve?
When attempting to integrate IT systems together it is rare that both systems will utalise the same primary key for a single entity. System A might know Bob by the key A103 and system B might know bob by the key pqkf-ajeb-dfkr. A directory can be used as a storage and identity correlation mechanism enabling an organisation to get more value out of its disparate systems.
